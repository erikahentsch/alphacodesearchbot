## How to use

To use the Alpha Code Search bot, type ```/code``` followed by either the species name or 4-letter alpha code. 
If the 4-letter code exists, or the bot can find the species by name (spelling counts!) the bot will respond with a species record that includes the species common name, scientific name and alpha code. 
For example: If you wanted to find out what the Alpha Code BEKI corresponds to, type ```/code BEKI``` and the bot will respond with a the species that matches the code.
The reverse works as well! If you type ```!code Belted Kingfisher``` the bot will respond with the same message.
